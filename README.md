# Dots & Boxes Programming Project

Welcome to the Dots & Boxes programming project, created by Michael Magdy Naguib and Mohamed Sabry Mansour. This project aims to bring the classic pencil-and-paper game to life in a digital format, offering players the opportunity to enjoy a strategic and engaging gaming experience.

## Features

### Game Modes
- Play with a friend or challenge a computer opponent.
- Choose from variable grid sizes for varied difficulty levels.

### Visual Design
- Enjoy an intuitive and visually appealing game interface.
- Colorful representation of the game state on the grid.

### Game Mechanics
- Turn-based gameplay with tactical and geometric components.
- Score tracking to keep tabs on player performance.
- Time tracking to monitor the duration of each game.

### Special Feature: Chain Box
- Implementing a Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm for handling chain boxes.
- Visualize the chain box feature to enhance gameplay complexity.

### Undo and Redo Functionality
- Correct moves with the ability to undo and redo actions.
- Maintain game history for seamless navigation through previous states.

### Save and Load
- Save game progress for continuity and resume gameplay at a later time.
- Load saved games to pick up where you left off.

### Ranking System
- Track player performance through a ranking system.
- Monitor progress and compare scores with other players.

## Design Overview

The project is structured to provide a seamless and intuitive gaming experience, incorporating key components such as:
- **Main:** Clears the console iteratively and initiates the game menu.
- **Menu:** Manages player inputs and game modes selection.
- **Grid:** Represents the playing grid with dots, lines, and boxes.
- **Player:** Stores player information including score, moves, and player type.
- **Game Logic:** Enforces game rules, tracks player turns, scores, and game-ending conditions.
- **Chain:** Utilizes DFS Algorithm for handling the chain box feature.
- **File Handling:** Manages saving and loading processes for game progress.
- **Top 10:** Manages player rankings for competitive gameplay.
